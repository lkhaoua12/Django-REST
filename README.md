# Product Management RESTful API

## Introduction

This project aims to create a RESTful API for managing product data, including CRUD operations, token-based authentication, permission management, pagination, reverse URL, and serialization.

## Instructions

### Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/lkhaoua12/Django-REST.git

2. Create a new virtual environment and activate it:
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Django-REST/dev


4. Install the project dependencies:
pip install -r requirement.txt


5. Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend


6. Start the Django development server:
python3 manage.py runserver


7. Access the Django Rest Framework built-in browser view:
http://localhost:8000/api/products/



8. Alternatively, you can access the API using the provided Python client:
